## C. Project Overview

### The Problem
Road surface irregularities—predominantly potholes and unscientific or unmarked speed breakers—are among the primary contributors to vehicular accidents, permanent spinal trauma, and extensive suspension damage worldwide. In emerging economies such as India, thousands of road fatalities occur annually due to sudden braking or evasive swerving when drivers encounter hazards without adequate warning distance.

### Inadequacy of Existing Systems
Traditional approaches to hazard management suffer from critical structural weaknesses:
1. **Manual Municipal Surveys:** Periodic visual inspections and complaint redressal portals have turnarounds spanning months.
2. **Crowdsourced Navigation Apps (e.g., Waze, Google Maps):** Require drivers to manually tap mobile screens while driving, introducing significant safety hazards. Furthermore, coverage is sparse on rural, semi-urban, and secondary arterial roads.
3. **Continuous Cloud Dependence:** Many mobile warning systems fail when cellular connectivity drops along national highways or mountain corridors.

### The RoadGuard Sensor-Based Approach
RoadGuard solves these limitations through an autonomous edge-cloud IoT architecture:
- A vehicle-mounted **ESP32 microcontroller** continuously samples high-frequency (50 Hz) linear accelerations and angular velocities from an **MPU-6050 6-axis IMU**.
- Real-time **GPS coordinates** from a **NEO-6M GPS module** (or fused smartphone location) are time-synchronized with sensor packets.
- Edge machine learning and physical impact heuristics classify road anomalies into **NORMAL**, **POTHOLE**, or **SPEED_BREAKER** within 15 milliseconds.

### The Route-Memory Concept
RoadGuard implements a persistent spatial memory network:
- Detected hazards are automatically geotagged and persisted in a local **Room database** (on the Android client) and synchronized with a cloud **Supabase PostgreSQL** repository.
- A **15-meter spatial deduplication algorithm** groups repeat detections, increments observation confidence, and elevates verification status without bloating the database.
- Once a hazard is recorded by any vehicle, it is permanently remembered.

### Advance Voice Warnings
When any vehicle approaches within 50–200 meters of a previously recorded hazard along its current heading, RoadGuard triggers an automated **voice synthesis announcement** (e.g., *"Warning: High severity Pothole 85 meters ahead"*), accompanied by an audible siren tone and haptic vibration. This empowers drivers to decelerate safely without ever glancing away from the windshield.

### Real Hardware Mode vs. Simulation Mode
RoadGuard is designed to operate seamlessly in two distinct environments:
- **Physical Hardware Mode:** The ESP32 collects physical accelerometer and GPS signals, transmitting 20-byte binary packets over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) using the Nordic UART Service to the Android client.
- **Simulation & Lab Demo Mode:** Built directly into both the Android app and the Web HUD dashboard, this mode permits comprehensive viva demonstrations, testing, and continuous integration without requiring physical road deployment or vehicle travel. Synthetic test data is strictly isolated (`source='TEST'`) so real baseline road records are never corrupted.

### Architectural Data Flow
1. **Sensing:** The MPU-6050 measures acceleration ($a_x, a_y, a_z$) and rotational velocity ($g_x, g_y, g_z$) at 50 Hz. The NEO-6M outputs NMEA sentences over UART.
2. **Transmission:** The ESP32 aggregates telemetry packets and broadcasts them over BLE GATT notifications.
3. **Edge Processing:** The Android application ingests packets into a 50-sample sliding FIFO buffer (1 second duration) and computes spatial and statistical features.
4. **Classification:** If a pothole or speed breaker pattern is recognized, an observation is generated with the current GPS fix.
5. **Route Memory Persistence:** The observation is written immediately to the local **Room DB**. If network connectivity is present, it is synchronized with Supabase.
6. **Proximity Alert:** As the vehicle moves, the proximity engine queries hazards within the configured threshold radius (50–200m). If the forward bearing matches the approach path, voice and audio warnings fire.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Offline-First Guarantee:** Proximity warnings for previously stored hazards do **not** require internet connectivity. All geospatial calculations run locally on the device. Network access is only required to synchronize new crowdsourced records with Supabase.

| `BLE_DEVICE_NAME_PREFIX` | No | Android & ESP32 | Bluetooth advertisement name prefix for filtering scan results | `RoadGuard-ESP32` |

### Supabase Cloud Setup & Migration Steps
1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Open the **SQL Editor** in the Supabase Dashboard.
3. Apply the SQL migrations located in `RoadGuard/supabase/migrations/` sequentially:
   - `0001_extensions_and_types.sql` (Creates enums: `hazard_type_enum`, `severity_enum`, `verification_status_enum`, `source_enum`)
   - `0002_profiles_and_devices.sql` (Creates `profiles` and `devices` tables)
   - `0003_trips_and_events.sql` (Creates `trips` and `trip_events` tables)
   - `0004_hazards_and_observations.sql` (Creates shared `hazards` map and `hazard_observations`)
   - `0005_settings_and_sync.sql` (Creates `user_settings` and `sync_receipts` tables)
   - `0006_indexes_and_functions.sql` (Creates geospatial indexes and timestamp triggers)
   - `0007_rls_policies.sql` (Applies strict Row Level Security policies)
   - `0008_triggers_and_privileges.sql` (Grants table permissions)
   *(Alternatively, execute `RoadGuard/supabase/full_schema_with_seed.sql` to execute all steps with Nagpur landmark seed data).*

### Row Level Security (RLS) Policy Design
Security is enforced at the database engine level:
- **`hazards`:** Authenticated users have read access (`SELECT`) to active confirmed hazards. Insertions force `verification_status = 'PENDING'`. Updates are restricted to server-side Edge Functions or the Python backend via `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
- **`hazard_observations`:** Strictly private. Drivers can only query observations matching their own authenticated `auth.uid()`.
- **`devices` & `trips`:** Enforces strict user ownership (`owner_id = auth.uid()` and `user_id = auth.uid()`).
- **`sync_receipts`:** Enforces unique `(user_id, operation_id)` pairs to ensure idempotent offline uploads.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Never Disable RLS:** Disabling Row Level Security to bypass permission errors allows public clients to overwrite or delete the shared hazard map. Server administrative jobs must use `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` to interact with protected tables.

## K. Machine-Learning Methodology

### Three Road Surface Classes
RoadGuard categorizes every road segment into one of three distinct classes:
1. **`NORMAL`:** Smooth or textured asphalt/concrete with nominal baseline vibrations ($\approx 9.81 \text{ m/s}^2$ vertical gravitational equilibrium with low variance). Normal events are never persisted to the hazard database.
2. **`POTHOLE`:** Structural depression in the road surface characterized by a sudden drop/free-fall ($\Delta a_z < -3.5 \text{ m/s}^2$) followed immediately by a sharp upward impact rebound and severe vertical jerk ($> 22 \text{ m/s}^3$).
3. **`SPEED_BREAKER`:** Engineered elevation bump characterized by an initial upward lift ($\Delta a_z > +2.8 \text{ m/s}^2$), sustained pitch gyroscope deflection ($g_y$), and moderate jerk.

### Sensor Windowing & Feature Extraction
Sensor data is evaluated in continuous sliding windows of **50 samples** (corresponding to **1.0 second** at 50 Hz):
- **Time-Domain Features:** Mean, standard deviation, variance, minimum, maximum, peak-to-peak range (`p2p`), root-mean-square (`rms`), kurtosis (tail-heaviness of impact), skewness, and crest factor.
- **Dynamic Physics Features:**
  - `az_max_jerk`: First derivative of vertical acceleration ($da_z / dt \times 50 \text{ Hz}$).

### Real Benchmark Evaluation Results
*(Source of truth: `RoadGuard/ml/scripts/evaluate_models.py` & `RoadGuard/server/ml_inference.py`)*

Evaluating on a stratified 20% test split (from the 3,000-sample dataset `roadguard_features_dataset.csv`):

| Algorithm | Precision (%) | Recall (%) | F1-Score (%) | Test Accuracy (%) | Inference Latency |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Random Forest (100 Trees)** | **94.8%** | **94.6%** | **94.7%** | **95.2%** | **12 ms** |
| Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) | 93.9% | 93.8% | 93.8% | 94.1% | 16 ms |
| Support Vector Machine (RBF) | 91.2% | 90.8% | 91.0% | 91.5% | 22 ms |
| 1D-CNN (Edge Deep Learning) | 94.1% | 93.9% | 94.0% | 94.5% | 18 ms |

#### Per-Class Metrics for Best Model (Random Forest)
- **Normal Road:** Precision: `97.4%` | Recall: `96.8%` | F1-Score: `97.1%`
- **Pothole:** Precision: `93.1%` | Recall: `94.9%` | F1-Score: `94.0%`
- **Speed Breaker:** Precision: `94.2%` | Recall: `93.5%` | F1-Score: `93.8%`

#### Top Discriminating Feature Importance
1. `az_p2p` (Vertical Acceleration Peak-to-Peak Range): **26.4%**
2. `az_max_jerk` (Z-Axis Rate of Acceleration Change): **21.8%**
3. `az_kurtosis` (Impulsiveness & Tail Thickness of Impact): **17.2%**
4. `gy_p2p` (Pitch Gyroscope Angular Rate Range): **12.6%**
5. `acc_mag_variance` (Total 3D Acceleration Variance): **9.5%**

### Dual Inference Pipeline
To ensure fail-safe operation:
- **Trained Model Inference:** When features are precomputed, Scikit-learn Random Forest outputs predictions and class probabilities.
- **Real-Time Physics Heuristic Engine (`ml_inference.py`):** Operates on raw 50-sample sliding windows with sub-2ms latency. If physical thresholds are violated (e.g., $a_z \text{ drop} < -3.5 \text{ m/s}^2$ with jerk $> 22 \text{ m/s}^3$), an anomaly event triggers immediately without waiting for full FFT computation.

## L. Hazard Detection and Route-Memory Workflow

The end-to-end operational pipeline progresses through 11 sequential phases:

```
[1. Sensor Sampling @ 50Hz] ──> [2. 50-Sample FIFO Buffer] ──> [3. Edge Classification (NORMAL/POTHOLE/BREAKER)]
                                                                               │
[7. Leaflet HUD Map Marker] <── [6. Local Room & Supabase Storage] <── [5. 15m Spatial Deduplication] <── [4. Valid GPS Lock]
           │
[8. Spatial Proximity Scan (50-200m)] ──> [9. Forward Bearing Calculation] ──> [10. Voice & Siren Alert] ──> [11. Offline Sync Queue]
```

1. **Sensor Acquisition:** ESP32 reads calibrated 6-axis data from MPU-6050 over I2C every 20ms (50 Hz).
2. **Buffer Sliding:** The stream fills a circular FIFO buffer maintaining the most recent 50 samples (1.0 second).
3. **Condition Classification:** The inference engine classifies the window. If categorized as `NORMAL`, no hazard record is created.
4. **GPS Fix Verification:** If classified as `POTHOLE` or `SPEED_BREAKER`, the system checks satellite coordinates. If `gps_fix: false`, the event is logged as an unmapped sensor anomaly.
5. **15-Meter Spatial Deduplication:** The backend calculates the Haversine distance against all existing active hazards within a bounding box. If a match is found within **15.0 meters**:
   - `observation_count` increments by 1.
   - `confidence` is updated via weighted running average.
   - If `observation_count >= 3`, status automatically transitions from `PENDING` to `VERIFIED`.
   - If no hazard exists within 15 meters, a new UUID hazard record is inserted.
6. **Persistence:** The observation is written to the local Room database and Supabase `hazards` / `hazard_observations` tables.
7. **Map Rendering:** The hazard marker renders dynamically on the Leaflet / OSMDroid map with distinct icons and popups.
8. **Proximity Surveillance:** Every 1.0 second, the client queries nearby hazards within the user-configured radius (default: 100 meters).
9. **Approach Angle Calculation:** The system compares the vehicle's heading with the forward bearing to the hazard:
   - Difference $\le 65^\circ$: `APPROACHING` (Hazard is in the direct forward path).
   - Difference $> 90^\circ$: `RECEDING` (Vehicle has passed the hazard).
   - Other: `LATERAL` (Hazard is on an adjacent parallel street).
10. **Audible & Voice Warning:** If `APPROACHING` and within the distance threshold, the Web Speech API / Android TTS engine speaks: *"Warning: High severity Pothole 85 meters ahead"*. An alert cooldown timer (default: 12 seconds per hazard ID) prevents repetitive notification spam.
11. **Idempotent Offline Sync:** If disconnected, operations queue in Android Room. Once online, `/api/sync` processes batches using `operation_id` receipts to guarantee zero duplicate records.

## Q. Troubleshooting

### 1. Backend Server Fails to Start (`Port 8000 already in use`)
- **Cause:** Another application or a previous instance of Uvicorn is occupying port 8000.
- **Solution (Windows PowerShell):**
  ```powershell
  Get-Process -Id (Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 8000).OwningProcess | Stop-Process -Force
  python app.py
  ```
- **Solution (Linux/macOS):**
  ```bash
  kill -9 $(lsof -ti:8000)
  python app.py
  ```

### 2. Supabase Connection Error / `DB: DISCONNECTED`
- **Cause:** Incorrect `SUPABASE_URL` or missing `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `server/.env`.
- **Solution:** Verify that your `.env` file exists in `RoadGuard/server/.env` and run `python init_db.py`. Verify that the Supabase project is active (not paused).

### 3. Leaflet Map Does Not Display Hazard Markers
- **Cause:** Database contains 0 active records, or active filters exclude all hazards.
- **Solution:** Click the **All** filter button on the map header. If the database is empty, click `💥 Test Pothole` or `⚠️ Test Breaker` in the Diagnostics Suite to inject test landmarks.

### 4. Browser Audio or Voice Warnings Do Not Play
- **Cause:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Firefox) block audio autoplay until the user interacts with the page.
- **Solution:** Click anywhere on the dashboard. Click `🚨 TEST SIREN` or `🗣️ TEST VOICE ALERT` once to grant audio authorization. Verify that `🔊 VOICE ALERTS: ON` is active.

### 5. GPS Reports `No Fix` or Coordinates Show `(0.0, 0.0)`
- **Cause:** Ceramic patch antenna does not have line-of-sight to GPS satellites indoors.
- **Solution:** Move the hardware near a window or outdoors. For indoor development, use the simulation controls on the dashboard or toggle Demo Mode in the Android app.

### 6. ESP32 Disconnected / BLE Scan Fails
- **Cause:** Bluetooth is disabled on the phone/PC, or location permission is missing on Android.
- **Solution:** On Android, ensure **Bluetooth** and **Location** are turned ON. In Android App Info, verify that **Nearby Devices** permission is granted. Check that the ESP32 is powered and the Serial Monitor shows `BLE advertising as RoadGuard-ESP32`.

### 7. Normal Road Condition Registered as a Hazard
- **Cause:** Incorrect API usage.
- **Solution:** `app.py` and the database explicitly reject `NORMAL` condition via `CHECK (hazard_type != 'NORMAL')`. If test scripts attempt to ingest `NORMAL`, the API returns `{"status": "ignored"}`.

## R. Security and Privacy

- **GPS Location Privacy:** Geolocation tracks are anonymized. The shared `hazards` map stores only the physical anomaly coordinates; personal identity (`created_by`) is hidden from public client queries.
- **Key Separation:** The `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` has administrative privileges and is restricted strictly to the server backend (`server/.env`). The mobile application and browser clients use only the public `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`.
- **Row Level Security Enforcement:** Every database table has RLS enabled with explicit policies in `0007_rls_policies.sql`. Users cannot read or delete other drivers' trips or raw sensor logs.
- **Idempotency Safeguards:** Offline sync requests use UUIDv4 `operation_id` receipts recorded in `sync_receipts`, preventing accidental replay attacks or network retry duplications.

## S. Limitations and Future Improvements

### Verified Current Limitations
1. **GPS Accuracy Under Bridges/Tunnels:** Standard NEO-6M single-band GPS accuracy degrades to 5–10 meters in urban canyons or covered tunnels, occasionally shifting hazard placement across parallel lanes.
2. **Vehicle Suspension Variances:** A stiff sports suspension produces higher vertical acceleration peaks over minor cracks compared to a soft SUV suspension, necessitating per-vehicle calibration.
3. **Weather Influences:** Flooded potholes filled with water exhibit modified hydrodynamic damping, which can alter accelerometer wave profiles.
4. **Local REST Server Requirement:** The web HUD currently connects to `localhost:8000`; deployment to cloud containers (Docker/Kubernetes) is planned for municipal access.

### Planned Future Improvements
- **On-Device TFLite Micro:** Porting the Random Forest / 1D-CNN classifier into C++ with TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers to run inference directly in ESP32 SRAM.
- **Computer Vision Fusion:** Combining smartphone dashcam optical segmentation (YOLOv8-tiny) with inertial IMU vibration signatures to verify pothole dimensions and depth before road impact.
- **Municipal Pothole Management Portal:** Web application for city public works departments with automated repair work-order ticketing, International Roughness Index (IRI) calculation, and repair verification tracking.
- **Dual-Band GNSS Integration:** Upgrading to multi-band RTK/GNSS modules for sub-meter lane-accurate hazard geolocation.
